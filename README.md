VMA revision: <!--REV-->[42be483bd5c6605e789e011aac684e0b95d05359](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator/tree/42be483bd5c6605e789e011aac684e0b95d05359) <!--/REV-->

This is a former fork of https://github.com/malte-v/VulkanMemoryAllocator-Hpp which is now maintained independently
as discussed in [this PR](https://github.com/malte-v/VulkanMemoryAllocator-Hpp/pull/15).

These bindings are generated by custom generator conforming to the structure of [Vulkan-Hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp).

Warning: The bindings are not thoroughly tested yet. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue.

## Usage
```c++
// In *one* source file:
#define VMA_IMPLEMENTATION

// If you don't like the `vma::` prefix:
#define VMA_HPP_NAMESPACE <prefix>

#include "vk_mem_alloc.hpp"
```
